# student-grade-prediction-using-Linear-regression
This case study predicts the grade/score of a student depending on the number of hours they studied using linear regression 

# Aim
The aim of the project is as follows;
 * Provide exploratory data analysis (EDA) inorder to know which variables to use for our model and give insights tha will help to improve the students performance 
   
 * To predict the score of a student who studies for 9.25 hours per day

 * The Algorithm will predict the marks a student is expected to score based on the number of hours they studied

 * Give an Analysis on how many student pass and fail

# About the Data
This is a sample dataset gotten off kaggle showing the

 * Hours: The hours the student takes to study to Hours of Study
 * Scores: This is th scores related to that from 0 to 100 score of the student ranging from 0 to 100
